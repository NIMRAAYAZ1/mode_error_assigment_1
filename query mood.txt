
--Goal: Here we use users table to pull a list of user email addresses. Edit the query to pull email
addresses, but only for non-deleted users.
SELECT email_address FROM dsv1069.users
where deleted_at is  null

--Goal: Use the items table to count the number of items for sale in each category
select count(id),category
FROM dsv1069.items 
group by category
--Goal: Select all of the columns from the result
--when you JOIN the users table to the orders
--tables 
select * from  dsv1069.users as v left JOIN dsv1069.orders as u
on  orders.user_id = users.id  


--Goal: Check out the query below. This is not the right way to count the number of viewed_item
SELECT
distinct(count( event_id ))
FROM dsv1069.events
WHERE event_name = 'view_item'

--Goal:Compute the number of items in the items table 
--which have been ordered. The query
--below runs, but it isn’t right. Determine 
--what is wrong and correct the error or start from scratch.

select count (distinct(orders.item_id))as item_code from 
dsv1069.orders 

----Goal: For each user figure out IF a user has ordered something, and when their first purchase
was. The query below doesn’t return info for any of the users who haven’t ordered anything.
SELECT ord.user_id, min(ord.paid_at)
FROM dsv1069.users as itm  left  outer JOIN dsv1069.orders AS ord 
ON ord.item_id = itm.id
GROUP BY ord.user_id 
ORDER By  ord.user_id
